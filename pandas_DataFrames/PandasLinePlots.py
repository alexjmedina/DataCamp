# You will work with a dataset consisting of monthly stock prices in 2015 for AAPL, GOOG, and IBM. The stock prices were obtained from Yahoo Finance. Your job is to plot the 'Month' column on the x-axis and the AAPL and IBM prices on the y-axis using a list of column names.
# Create a list of y-axis column names: y_columns
y_columns = ['AAPL','IBM']

# Generate a line plot
df.plot(x='Month', y=y_columns)

# Add the title
plt.title('Monthly stock prices')

# Add the y-axis label
plt.ylabel('Price ($US)')

# Display the plot
plt.show()
